= TomEE Website Proposal

== Build

To build the final website just use:

[source]
----
mvn compile
----

For development `mvn compile -Djbake.http=true` starts a server on http://localhost:8080 and auto refreshes
pages after updates.


Then website is generated in `target/site-${version}` and you just need to sync it with CMS repo.

NOTE: it also opens the door to documentation versioning with subfolder per version like maven does.

TIP: the rendering is just a main so if the process doesn't work for you just enrich it in `JBake` class.

== Extensions

Build will generate a PDF for each page containing the attribute `jbake-tomeepdf`.
