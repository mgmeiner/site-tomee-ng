= TomEE Website Proposal

== Build

To build the final website just use:

[source]
----
mvn compile pre-site
----

For development `mvn jbake:inline` starts a server on http://localhost:8080 and auto refreshes
pages after updates but you need to have called `compile pre-site` before.


Then website is generated in `target/site-${version}` and you just need to sync it with CMS repo.

NOTE: it also opens the door to documentation versioning with subfolder per version like maven does.

== Extensions

Build will generate a PDF for each page containing the attribute `jbake-tomeepdf`.
